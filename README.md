# AIME — Artificial Intelligence Made Easy

AIME is a rule-based business decision system designed to support MSME-level
operational decisions using deterministic logic and historical decision records.

The system focuses on disciplined decision-making, loss prevention, and
constraint-based evaluation rather than prediction or automation.

## Core Purpose

To convert business inputs into clear, repeatable decisions by applying
predefined rules, operational constraints, and historical decision outcomes.

AIME is built to prevent costly mistakes by learning from what has already
failed in the past.

---

## Modules in AIME

AIME consists of four fixed modules:

1. Manufacturer Module  
2. Transport Module  
3. Digital Twin Module  
4. DMCE (Decision-Making Cost Evaluation)

Each module operates independently with strict logic boundaries.

---

## Manufacturer Module

Evaluates manufacturing-related decisions using inputs such as production
capacity, cost thresholds, and operational constraints.

The module determines whether a manufacturing decision is feasible within
defined limits before execution.

---

## Transport Module

Evaluates transport and logistics decisions using factors such as availability,
capacity limits, movement cost, and operational feasibility.

The module ensures transport decisions remain within acceptable cost and
capacity boundaries.

---

## Digital Twin Module

Simulates operational scenarios using the same decision rules applied to
real operations.

This allows businesses to observe decision outcomes without executing them
in the real world.

---

## DMCE (Decision-Making Cost Evaluation) Module

Evaluates proposed decisions against historical decision outcomes and past
mistake records.

The module analyzes previous losses, failed decisions, and cost overruns to
estimate the potential downside of repeating similar decisions.

DMCE is designed to prevent recurrence of known failures by applying
loss-first logic based on historical data.

## Decision Characteristics

- Rule-based and deterministic  
- Same inputs produce the same output  
- Uses historical decision outcomes  
- No machine learning or prediction  
- Focused on loss prevention and risk control

## Intended Use

This project demonstrates structured decision logic, risk evaluation, and
historical cost analysis suitable for analyst, operations, and decision-support
roles.
